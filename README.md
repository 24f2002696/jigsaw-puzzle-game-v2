# Jigsaw Puzzle Master

## Overview
Jigsaw Puzzle Master is an interactive web application that allows users to upload their own images and transform them into customizable jigsaw puzzles. Users can select the difficulty level to control the puzzle piece count, drag and drop pieces to solve the puzzle, track their solving time and moves, and preview the original image for assistance. This application provides an engaging and personalized puzzle-solving experience directly within the browser.

## Features
- **Custom Image Upload:**  Users can upload images from their local devices to create personalized jigsaw puzzles.  Supported image formats include JPEG, PNG, and GIF. The application dynamically resizes the uploaded image to fit within the puzzle container while maintaining aspect ratio.
- **Difficulty Level Selection:**  Users can choose from four difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert), corresponding to grid sizes of 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, and 6x6 respectively. This feature allows users to adjust the challenge to their skill level.
- **Automatic Puzzle Generation:**  Upon image upload and difficulty selection, the application automatically slices the image into the appropriate number of puzzle pieces based on the chosen grid size. The pieces are then randomly shuffled on the game board.
- **Drag-and-Drop Interaction:**  Users can drag and drop puzzle pieces using their mouse or touch input.  The application utilizes smooth drag-and-drop functionality for a seamless user experience.
- **Piece Snapping:**  When a puzzle piece is dragged close enough to its correct position, it automatically snaps into place. This functionality provides helpful feedback to the user and simplifies the puzzle-solving process.  The snapping distance is dynamically adjusted based on the puzzle difficulty.
- **Visual Placement Feedback:**  A subtle border highlight is applied to a puzzle piece when it is correctly placed, providing immediate visual feedback to the user.  This utilizes CSS classes that are toggled on the element using JavaScript.
- **Timer and Move Counter:**  A timer tracks the elapsed time from the start of the puzzle until completion.  A move counter records the total number of piece movements. These metrics provide a performance measure for the user.
- **Image Preview:**  A "Preview" button allows users to temporarily overlay the complete original image on top of the puzzle board, providing a reference for solving the puzzle.  The overlay utilizes CSS positioning and opacity manipulation.
- **Reset and New Puzzle Buttons:**  A "Reset" button reshuffles the current puzzle, allowing users to start over with the same image. A "New Puzzle" button allows users to upload a different image and start a new puzzle.
- **Victory Screen:**  Upon completing the puzzle, a victory screen displays the user's completion time and number of moves.  This provides positive reinforcement and encourages continued play.
- **Responsive Design:**  The application is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience across various devices.  This is achieved through CSS media queries and flexible layout techniques.

## Code Explanation

### Architecture
The application follows a modular, client-side architecture. The HTML provides the structure and UI elements. CSS styles the application. JavaScript handles the image upload, puzzle generation, drag-and-drop functionality, snapping logic, timer, move counter, and victory screen.

The main JavaScript file (`script.js` - assume this is the name) is organized into several key functions:
*   **`initialize()`**: Sets up event listeners for button clicks (image upload, difficulty selection, preview, reset, new puzzle).
*   **`handleImageUpload()`**: Processes the uploaded image, resizing it, and calling `createPuzzle()` to generate the puzzle pieces.
*   **`createPuzzle(image)`**:  Slices the image into pieces based on the selected difficulty, shuffles the pieces, and adds them to the puzzle container. This includes attaching drag and drop event handlers.
*   **`dragElement(element)`**:  Handles the drag and drop functionality for the puzzle pieces, updating the piece's position and triggering snapping logic.  (This uses jQuery UI).
*   **`checkPosition(piece)`**:  Determines if the piece is close enough to its correct position and snaps it into place, updating the puzzle completion status.
*   **`updateTimer()`**:  Updates the timer display every second.
*   **`updateMoveCount()`**:  Increments and displays the move counter.
*   **`displayVictoryScreen()`**: Shows the victory screen with completion time and move count when the puzzle is solved.

### Key Components
- **Image Slicing (`createPuzzle()` function in `script.js`):** This component takes the uploaded image and divides it into rectangular pieces according to the selected difficulty level (grid size).  It dynamically creates `<img>` elements for each piece, sets their `src` attributes to represent portions of the original image using `drawImage()` on a temporary canvas element, and positions them absolutely within the puzzle container. The decision to use `drawImage` allows for direct manipulation of image data, a more efficient approach compared to potentially numerous image loading and manipulation cycles.

    ```javascript
    // Example from within createPuzzle function
    const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
    canvas.width = pieceWidth;
    canvas.height = pieceHeight;
    const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    ctx.drawImage(image, pieceX, pieceY, pieceWidth, pieceHeight, 0, 0, pieceWidth, pieceHeight);

    const pieceImage = new Image();
    pieceImage.src = canvas.toDataURL();  // Convert canvas to base64 data URL for image source
    ```

- **Drag and Drop Interaction (Using jQuery UI in `dragElement()` function in `script.js`):**  This component allows users to drag and drop puzzle pieces. jQuery UI's draggable functionality is used to enable the drag and drop behavior. The `stop` event of the draggable interaction is used to trigger the `checkPosition` function, which handles the snapping logic. The usage of jQuery UI simplified a robust drag and drop experience and prevented the need to code more complicated cross-browser event handling.

    ```javascript
    // Example Usage (Inside dragElement() function)
    $(element).draggable({
      stop: function(event, ui) { // When the user stops dragging
        checkPosition(element);
      }
    });
    ```

### Algorithm/Logic
The core logic of the application revolves around the puzzle generation and solving process.

1.  **Image Slicing:** The algorithm divides the image into a grid of `n x n` pieces, where `n` is determined by the difficulty level. The starting coordinates of each puzzle piece on the original image are calculated using the formula: `(row * pieceHeight, column * pieceWidth)`. The `drawImage()` method of the Canvas API is used to extract the corresponding portion of the image for each puzzle piece.

2.  **Piece Shuffling:**  The puzzle pieces are randomly shuffled using the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm. This ensures that the pieces are not in their correct positions at the start of the game.

    ```javascript
    // Example (Simplified Fisher-Yates shuffle)
    function shuffleArray(array) {
      for (let i = array.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
        [array[i], array[j]] = [array[j], array[i]]; // Swap elements
      }
    }
    ```

3.  **Snapping Logic:**  When a puzzle piece is dragged, the application calculates the distance between its current position and its correct position. If the distance is less than a certain threshold (snap distance), the piece is automatically snapped into place. The snap distance is dynamically adjusted based on the difficulty level.  A smaller snap distance makes the game harder. This snapping calculation uses the Pythagorean theorem to determine the distance: `distance = sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)`.

4.  **Victory Condition:**  The application checks for the victory condition by iterating through all the puzzle pieces and verifying that each piece is in its correct position. If all pieces are correctly placed, the victory screen is displayed.

### Error Handling
- **Image Upload Errors:** The application provides feedback to the user if the uploaded image is not a supported format or if there is an error during the image loading process. An alert message is displayed to inform the user of the error.
- **General Errors:** A generic error handler is implemented to catch any unexpected errors that may occur during the execution of the application. The error is logged to the console, and an alert message is displayed to the user.
